# Manual Test Guide for Enhanced Setup

## ✅ **What We've Built**

The enhanced setup now includes:

1. **Browser Detection** - Automatically detects Chrome, Vivaldi, Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. **History Analysis** - Shows your top visited sites before you select categories
3. **Conflict Detection** - Warns you which sites would be blocked
4. **Interactive Exceptions** - Lets you add sites to whitelist during setup
5. **Seamless Integration** - Everything works together automatically

## 🧪 **Manual Testing Steps**

### **Test 1: Browser Detection**
```bash
# Run the setup script and see if it detects your browser
sudo ./setup-hosts-blocker.sh
```
**Expected**: Should show detected browsers and let you select one

### **Test 2: History Analysis**
```bash
# Test history checker directly
./simple-history-check.sh
```
**Expected**: Should show your top 20 most visited sites

### **Test 3: Category Conflict Detection**
```bash
# Test with social category
./simple-history-check.sh social
```
**Expected**: Should show which sites would be blocked by social media blocking

### **Test 4: Whitelist Management**
```bash
# Add LinkedIn to whitelist
./whitelist-manager.sh add linkedin.com

# Check if it's whitelisted
./whitelist-manager.sh check linkedin.com

# List all whitelisted sites
./whitelist-manager.sh list
```
**Expected**: LinkedIn should be added and listed

### **Test 5: End-to-End Setup**
```bash
# Run full setup with browser detection and exception handling
sudo ./setup-hosts-blocker.sh
```
**Expected**: 
1. Detects your browser
2. Shows your top sites
3. Asks for categories
4. Shows conflicts
5. Offers to add exceptions
6. Completes setup
